                          may be wondering exactly where to start. You'll need to decide how much cardio and

                          worse, getting injured, is a challenge as well.

                         <p>Cardiovascular exercise, technically, is any activity that elevates your heart rate to 
                            improve the function of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system, explains Openfit fitness
                            expert Cody Braun.
                           
                            However, when most people talk about cardio, what they’re referring to is a certain type 
                            of cardiovascular exercise, called aerobic exercise. The difference may seem small, 
                            but it’s important.</p>
                            <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL+"https://cdn.prod.openfit.com/uploads/2019/07/31172835/cardio-beginners.jpg"} alt="mypic" />
                         <h3 style={{color: "red"}}>How Much Cardio Should I Do?</h3>
                         <p>Federal guidelines recommend that, for overall health, adults perform at least 2 ½ to 5 hours per week of 
                            moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; 75 minutes to 2 ½ hours per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical
                            activity; or an equivalent combination of the two. The guidelines also prescribe spreading aerobic activity 
                            throughout the week</p>
                         <h4 style={{color: "red"}}>1.Warm up first (really)</h4>
                         <p>“You should always include a warm-up before jumping into any form of exercise in order
                             to prep your cardiovascular system and your muscles for the upcoming work,” Braun says.
                             He recommends dynamic stretches and bodyweight exercises that mimic the movements you’ll
                             perform during your workout.
                            
                             For example, if you’re going to run, lunges and leg swings are great options. Before 
                             a rowing workout, squats and upper body mobility exercises can help prime your muscles.
                         </p><img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL+"https://cdn.prod.openfit.com/uploads/2019/07/31173011/cardio-beginners-lunge.jpg"} alt="mypic" />
                         <h3 style={{color: "red"}}>2.Choose form over volume</h3>
                         <p>Whether you’re a beginner or gym rat, your workouts should always focus on technique over
                             pushing for reps or distance. Start with low-intensity steady-state cardio or even some light
                             circuit training, prioritizing low-impact exercises, before progressing to high-intensity training.

                             “As you build cardiovascular and muscular endurance you’ll prime your body for more vigorous
                              forms of exercise like plyometrics or high-intensity interval training,” Braun says. Sorry, 
                              HIIT for beginners is generally not advised. Don’t worry; you’ll get there!

                         <h3 style={{color: "red"}}>3.Don’t be boring</h3>
                            <p>Venture outside your comfort zone and mix up your routine with activities, variations, and loads
                               both familiar and alien. “Like most other concepts in fitness, once your workouts start to become 
                               easier for you, it might be time to progress and apply harder training modalities,” Braun says.
                         </p><img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL+"https://cdn.prod.openfit.com/uploads/2019/07/31173546/cardio-beginners-woman-lifting-768x513.jpg"} alt="mypic" />
                         <h3 style={{color: "red"}}>4.Hydrate religiously</h3>
                            <p>Pay attention to your hydration levels, he says. According to the American Council on Exercise, you
                               should drink 7 to 10 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes during exercise. This is especially important when
                               performing sweat-heavy workouts or doing cardio in hot or humid weather.
                         </p>

                            <h3 style={{color: "red"}}>5.Listen to your body</h3>
                           <p>Cardio can be challenging for beginners — and it should be — but it shouldn’t feel painful. If you 
                              experience any pain in your muscles or joints during exercise, take that as your body giving you information,
                              and don’t just “push through.” Also pay attention to how you feel in the 48 hours immediately following your 
                              workouts — while it’s OK to be a little sore, you shouldn’t be in pain.

                         <h2 style={{color: "red"}}>Cardio Exercises for Beginners.</h2>
                          <p>The best cardio exercise for beginners is the one that you most enjoy and will perform consistently.
                             Here are some common at-home cardio options — and tips for performing them safely and effectively.</p>
                          <h2 style={{color: "red"}}>Walking</h2>
                          <p>Even a leisurely stroll can help improve your cardio but, when able, try to walk at a brisk pace 
                             (3.5 mph or more) that increases your heart rate.<br/>
                              When walking outside, stay aware of your surroundings. Follow all traffic signals and, if you wear
                              headphones, do so at a low volume that allows you to hear what’s going on around you.</p>
                           <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL+"https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/dec/benefits-of-morning-walk1575284177.jpg"} alt="mypic" />
                                <h2 style={{color: "red"}}>Running</h2>
                                              <p>
                                    Before starting, get fitted for a pair of shoes at a specialty running store. Or, if you have
                                    a history of previous injury or foot issues, consider discussing your shoe options with a podiatrist
                                    or physical therapist.<br/>
                                    For beginners, it can be hard to pull back and not perform every run at top speed. Remember, if the
                                    goal is to work your aerobic system or run for more than 20 minutes, you should be breathing at a 
                                    calm enough rate that you can carry on a conversation.</p>

                                   <h2 style={{color: "red"}}>Cycling</h2> 
                                                   <p>
                                    When adjusting the bike, your legs should not fully extend during each pedal stroke. With the ideal
                                    set-up, when you press the pedal as far from you as possible, you should maintain a slight bend in
                                    your knees.<br/>

                                    If cycling on an upright bike, keep your core braced, back neutral, and shoulders pulled down away
                                    from your ears throughout. You should not hunch or scrunch over the handlebars.
                                          </p>
                                          <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL+"https://cdn.cdnparenting.com/articles/2018/07/692127646-H.jpg"} alt="mypic" />

                            <p>
                                   For safety, always fasten the stop clip to your clothing. If you lose speed, stumble, or fall, 
                                   this will help you immediately stop the machine to reduce the risk of injury.<br/>
                                   Maintain your arm swing! You shouldn’t have to hold onto the rails to walk or run. If you do 
                                   need to, you are likely exercising at too great an incline and need to lower it.

                                      Use the handlebars to keep your arms pumping, or swing your arms down at your sides as if you
